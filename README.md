Horizontal Phone Stands
=======================

Stand to hold your phone at an angle (forwards or backwards) in
landscape orientation. It accounts for the center of the phone's
width. I designed and printed these on Christmas morning so we could
place a Nexus S phone on a bookshelf, tilting down, to video
conference with family.

Instructions
------------

* Measure your phone's width and thickness
* Enter these values (with some thickness margin) in the .scad file
* Print a pair
* Position on either end of your phone outside the screen
* Tilt forward or backward as desired

I provided 11.3 mm and 9 mm examples that fit each end of the Nexus S
- they are different thicknesses.
